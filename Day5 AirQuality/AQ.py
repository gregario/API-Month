# So I'm going to make 4 lists, of name, sensor ID, lat, lng. I would be cleaner to make a list of JSON objects but screw it. 
#for key in r: # the returned object is a list with nested JSON objects inside each list. So you need to iterate through the list and do operations on each object separately
#ß	print key['Site']['@SiteCode'] # Adds expected arrival time from each train data structure to the time list

#print aq[0,1]
#print str(r['Sites']['@SiteCode'])
