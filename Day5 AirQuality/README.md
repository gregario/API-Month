Bit of background on this one. I decided to do something a bit more abitious today. Since I now have the basic building blocks of data for getting and 
manipulating JSON API data I thought I would put it to the test for something more than one localised test. 
So today I'm going to build something chunkier. I have some knowledge of the London Air Quality Array by kings college. Its a cool system. 
It gives free open access to AQ data from London sources. I want to build an app that if you put in a post code in London it finds the nearest AQ monitor
From the list and returns its air quality data.
