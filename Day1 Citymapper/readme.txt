This is the first of a month challange to code a simple API based program every day. They will be simple, sometimes silly and almost always written in python. 
The intention is that this will take an hour max so I'll only make a pyhsical implementation of the system if time allows! 

I have to decide every day if I am going to cycle to work or take my local train. Lots of info helps me make this decision.
How long will the train take? 
Will it rain? 
How hungover am I? 

Now API's can't help with the last one (although google now is getting pretty close to being able to guess) but it can help with the first two. 
To start today I thought I would start with a really simple one, how long will it take to get to work by train? 

This can very variable. I have to change from train to tube and then change tube too to get to work. Its a pain. So hence why I check. 
So I wrote this simple program, Train.py, to check to see my estimated commuting time to work. As my bike commute is a pretty predictable 44-48 minutes i can then make a decision.

Tomorrow I'll look at a weather service to find out will it rain and if it will rain during the day. Should be fun :)
