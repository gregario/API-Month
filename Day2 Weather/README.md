Day two is still simple. Once I know how long my train will take I should find out the weather, right? 
I use weather underground to do this. 

While I'm programming the API's I will go through simple programming techniques needed to work with these systems, today I cover:
- Nested JSON calls
- Passing arguments from the command line when starting a python program
- Concatonating strings, this is handy for placing the arguments passed in (from a program or another function) into a string for the API call.
