Today was all about using the TFL API to find the arrival time of my local trains. Its actually the problem the inspired the month of API. When I tried to implement I thought
it would be good to warm up to it over a couple of days. Hence why I tackled it on day three. 

There's some good stuff here, operating on, iterating over and extracting conditional data from JSON objects. Also doing operations on time while pulling the current 
real time from the python datetime module. 

Enjoy!
